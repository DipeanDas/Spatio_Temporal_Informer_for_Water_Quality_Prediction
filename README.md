# Spatio-Temporal Informer(ST-Informer) Model
This repository contains the implementation of a **Scalable Informer-based deep learning architecture** for **water quality forecasting**. The model is trained and tested on **multivariate water quality data** collected from various locations of the **16 major rivers Indian Himalayan Rivers**. Although demonstrated on the Indian Rivers dataset, the architecture is **generalizable**, **customizable** and can be applied to **other river systems or water quality monitoring datasets**.<br>
An interactive **Flask-based web interface** is also developed to deploy the trained model for near-accurate prediction and visualization.

### Notes and Precautions
While the ST-Informer architecture is scalable and adaptable aspects like hyperparameters, sequence lengths, and preprocessing steps should be tuned according to the specific dataset and forecasting objective. For different data structures, temporal resolutions, or experimental setups, appropriate modifications to the data loading and preprocessing pipeline may be required to ensure correct training and evaluation.
